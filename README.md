# QR-Code-Generator    
This repository contains a QR code generator built using Node.js. It utilizes the libraries Inquirer and qr-image to provide a seamless and efficient QR code generation experience.    
## Introduction     
During my journey of learning web development in the Angela Web Development Course of 2023, I created this QR code generator as a practical project. The main goal was to implement a Node.js application that allows users to easily generate QR codes for various purposes.  

The application will prompt you to enter the data you want to encode into a QR code. Once you provide the necessary information, the QR code will be generated and saved in the project directory.      
## Features    
+ Generate QR codes with ease.
+ Supports various data types, including URLs, text, and more.
+ Interactive command-line interface powered by the Inquirer library. 
+ Utilizes the qr-image library for efficient QR code generation.    
## Dependencies   
The following dependencies are used in this project:
+ Inquirer: A command-line interface library for Node.js. 
+ qr-image: A library for generating QR codes.
## Acknowledgements
I would like to express my gratitude to Angela Yu for her comprehensive web development course, which served as the foundation for this project. The course provided me with the knowledge and skills necessary to develop this QR code generator using Node.js.
